### Goal :

1. Install git and command line git bash. 
2. Use git commands to manage, work and update a remote repository.

##### * We have been using GitHub website to host our code online. 

##### * GitHub uses a tool called Git which is used to keep track of all the changes in the code. 

##### * It is a very powerful tool for developers to keep track of the changes they are making in their code and collaborating with others. 

##### * We will learn more about Git in today's class. But before that, we need to install Git into our system.

##### Developers use git to collaborate on their work. 

##### In fact, two developers can often work on the same code base using git. Git promotes collaboration.

STEPS:

1. Instal:
   * MAC: https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/
   * WINDOWS: https://gitforwindows.org/

2. Open  git bash shell (for Windows) or a normal terminal (for Mac). 
   * Every computer uses a hard drive which is its memory. 
   * A hard drive is divided into sections and each section has a name. 
   * Each section can be divided into more sections called folders. 
   * Each folder may contain a file or another folder.
   * This is a very powerful window. Can do a lot of things from here. 
   * Let's check which section of the computer's memory we are in right now. We do this by typing 'pwd'. **pwd** stands for **present working directory**.
     * You can see all the files and folders that are present in this location right here in the window.
     * You need to type the command **'ls'** to list down all the files in this location.
       * Can navigate to any other folder or directory and see the files/folders there. 
       * We use **'cd' (change directory)** command to change the terminal's location to any other directory location.Need to enter the complete address of the location.
         * You need to type cd <SPACE><location of new directory>
         * You can then use ‘ls’ to list down the contents of that directory.
           * We can also create a new directory/folder in any location using **'mkdir'** commands.
           *  'mkdir' stands for **make directory**. 
           * Need to type mkdir <SPACE> <Name and location pf teh new directory>
           *  If only the name of the directory is given, the directory is created in the default location. Use ‘mkdir’ and then ‘ls’ to show the directory created.

3. Earlier, we used to download the files in a zipped format, then unzipped and opened them in the visual code studio. Now we don't need to do that. We can simply clone the Github repository using the "git clone" command.
   * git clone https://github.com/whitehatjr/angryBirdsStage2
   * ls ; cd ; ls

4. Create a big platform for our slingshot. We will do this by creating a new Ground object using the Ground class in our sketch.js file.

   ```javascript
   function setup()
   {
     platform = new Ground(150,305,300,170);
   }
   fucntion draw()
   {
     platform.display();
   }
   ```

   

5. We have the code ready for the platform. git knows that we have made some changes. You can use '**git status**' to see that git knows that there have been some changes made.

6. There are three areas when we are working with git: -
   * there is a working directory. 
   * there is a staging area. 
   * there is a repository (local and remote).

7. Files are first modified in the working directory - just like we did right now when we modified the sketch.js file. 

   * Staging area hosts all the files which are changed before they are committed. 

   * A repository hosts all the different committed versions of the files. 

   * Every modified file travels from working directory to staging area to a repository.

   * We need to add our sketch.js file to the staging area and then commit these changes (just like we did on Github after making changes to a file). 

   * Every commit is written with a commit message - so that later you can see the changes you made to the files.

     git add<file_name>

     git commit -m "<message>"

      (-m stands for message)

git add sketch.js

git commit -m "Add platform"

8. Now that we have made some changes into our code, we can push this code directly to our remote github repository.

   * For this, we have to create an empty remote Github Repository. 

   * Create an empty remote GitHub repository. 

   * Note: DO NOT INCLUDE A README.md file.

   * Now we need to associate the working directory on our git bash shell to this remote repository. 

   * We do this using the 'git remote add' command. 

     git remote add  <remote_name> <remote_github_url>

   * Can use any name for the <remote_name>.

   * Need to use the url of the github repository you just created.

git remote add test https://github.com/whitehatjr/AmgryBirdsStage2.5StudentActivity

9. Finally we have the committed changes stored in our local repository. 

   * We want to push these files and changes to our remote repository we just created.

     git push -u <remote_name>

     (-u stands for username)

     * Note: A username is needed so that the codebase gets uploaded in your relevant account.

git push -u angryBirds2.5

Username 

Password

Check the remote repository url now by visiting github.com. Login and you will see the files have been updated there.

10. You can see all the commits ever made on this repository by typing the command "git log".

We learned:-

*  the use of git commands to - clone a repository. 
* stage and commit changes in a file in a repository. 
* push the changes to a remote repository.
